            PUFFIN is a new pulsed-power facility at the <a href="https://www.psfc.mit.edu/">Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC)</a>,
            at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). PUFFIN (the <i>PUlser For Fundamental [Plasma Physics] INvestigations</i>) will 
            use intense pulses of electrical current to heat solids to a high-energy-density (HED) plasma state.

        <p>
            These plasmas will be accelerated by the strong magnetic fields generated by the intense currents, 
            creating long-lasting flows of magnetized plasma which mimic the extreme conditions found in 
            astrophysical objects.
        </p>

        <p>
            We will use PUFFIN to carry out research into fundamental plasma processes, such as magnetic reconnection and
            magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence, which underpin events such as solar flares and the transport of matter in 
            the accretions disks of black holes.

            You can find out more about PUFFIN <a href="/assets/posters/APSDPP2020_PUFFIN_Poster_lowres.pdf">in this poster</a> we 
            presented at APS DPP 2020. PUFFIN is currently in the design phase, with construction expected to begin in 2022, 
            and experiments in 2023. As of May 2022, some of the first components have already arrived for the facility. 
            We are <a href="/work-with-us">actively seeking undergraduate and graduate students</a> to work on 
            the design and construction of PUFFIN, and subsequent experiments.
