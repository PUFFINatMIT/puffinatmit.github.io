            PUFFIN is a new pulsed-power facility at the <a href="https://www.psfc.mit.edu/">Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC)</a>,
            at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). PUFFIN (the <i>PUlser For Fundamental [Plasma Physics] INvestigations</i>) will 
            use intense pulses of electrical current to heat initally solid loads made from thin wires or foils to a high-energy-density (HED) plasma state.
        </p>

        <p>
            These plasmas will be accelerated by the strong magnetic fields generated by the intense currents, 
            creating long-lasting flows of magnetized plasma which mimic the extreme conditions found in 
            astrophysical objects.
        </p>

        <p>
            We will use PUFFIN to carry out research into fundamental plasma processes, such as <a href="/research/reconnection/">magnetic reconnection</a> and
            <a href="/research/turbulence/">magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence</a>, which underpin events such as solar flares and the transport of matter in 
            the accretions disks of black holes.
			The same physical processes are important in <a href="/research/fusion/">magnetized target fusion</a>, a hybrid between the mainstream magnetically confined and inertially confined fusion concepts.

            You can find out more about PUFFIN <a href="/assets/posters/APSDPP2020_PUFFIN_Poster_lowres.pdf">in this poster</a> we 
            presented at APS DPP 2020. PUFFIN is currently in the design phase, with construction starting in 2022, 
            and experiments in 2023. As of May 2022, the major pulsed-power components have arrived. 
            We are <a href="/work-with-us">actively seeking undergraduate and graduate students</a> to work on 
            the design and construction of PUFFIN, and subsequent experiments.
