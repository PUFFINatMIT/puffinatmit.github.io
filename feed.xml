PUFFIN (the PUlser For Fundamental  [Plasma Physics] INvestigations) will use intense pulses of electrical current to heat  solids to a high-energy-density (HED) plasma state. We will use PUFFIN to carry out  research into fundamental plasma processes, such as magnetic reconnection and  magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence, which underpin events such as solar flares and  the transport of matter in the accretions disks of black holes.</subtitle><author><name>Jack Hare</name></author><entry><title type="html">PUFFIN structural supports</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/news/2022/08/08/PUFFIN-supports.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="PUFFIN structural supports" /><published>2022-08-08T12:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2022-08-08T12:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/news/2022/08/08/PUFFIN-supports</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/news/2022/08/08/PUFFIN-supports.html"><![CDATA[<p>The support structure for PUFFIN is almost completed!

The MR2022 conference brought together a wide array of different research fields, all of which are focused on the study of magnetic reconnection. Many experimental plasma physicists, theorists, astrophysicists, and space weather scientists (from the MMS mission) were in attendance, contributing to a wonderful week of scientific discussion. Jack presented recent data and simulations from the MARZ experiment, whilst Thomas presented a poster on the MAIZE guide-field reconnection experiments. In addition to all the interesting science, we were able to enjoy the natural beauty of the Monterey coastline, and the incredible abundance of marine wildlife!</p>

This year’s theme was “Foundations and Fontiers”, and students were encouraged to demonstrate the societal impact of their research field. Thomas presented some initial results from his experiments on the MAIZE pulsed-power facility at the University of Michigan, and how these results along with PUFFIN can help develop our understanding of space weather and solar storms. For his poster, Thomas was awarded both the Judges’ and Peoples’ choice awards; congratulations!</p>

Jack and Thomas are back from the PUFFIN group’s first experimental trip to the MAIZE facility at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. They spent a fortnight working on pulsed-power experiments to study magnetic reconnection in a guide field. Using an externally-powered Helmholtz coil in conjunction with the MAIZE pulsed-power facility, they tested a scaled-down dual exploding wire array load, similar to experiments previously conducted on the MAGPIE pulsed-power facility at Imperial College London. We are very grateful for the support provided by the MAIZE team, and we look forward to getting back to MIT and properly analyzing our results!</p>
