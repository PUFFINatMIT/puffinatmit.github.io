# The Machine

PUFFIN is designed to deliver an intense pulse of electrical current to a "load", and arrangement of thin wires or foils which are rapidly converted into hot, dense plasma. PUFFIN's unique capability is it's microsecond pulse length, in contrast to fast rise-time pulsers such as [MAIZE](https://plasmabay.engin.umich.edu/research/michigan-accelerator-for-inductive-z-pinch-experiments-maize/) and [HADES](http://gourdain.pas.rochester.edu/index.php/research/experiment/hades), which drive rapid implosions to reach extreme conditions. Instead, the longer pulse length on PUFFIN allow us to sustain plasmas in a quasi-steady-state, which is ideal for studying fundamental plasma processes.

PUFFIN is built around the LTD5 modules developed at CEA Gramat. LTDs are Linear Transformer Drivers, a relatively new pulsed-power technology which encloses the capacitive energy store and switch in a single conducting cavity. This reduces the inductance of the system and shields external equipment from the electromagnetic pulse.

PUFFIN is currently in the design phase. Two LTD5 modules, along with the charge-and-dump, premagnetisation, and switch trigger systems arrived at the PSFC in May 2022. Refurbishment of the lab space in the West Cell of the PSFC (MIT building NW21) is expected to be finished by the end of SUmmer 2022.The conceptual design above uses eight LTD5 modules (or stages) arranged in four lines of two modules each. The modules stacked in series increase the overall voltage of the pulse, and the modules stacked in parallel increase the total current. The capacitors (shown in brown) will be charged to around 70 kV, and then discharged through triggered multi-channel, low inductance switches into a vacuum coaxial transmission line.

The four transmission lines converge inside a vacuum chamber (shown in a cutaway view above) and the transmission line tapers vertically to present a coaxial transmission line at the base of the large cylindrical vacuum chamber. The tall windows will provide excellent diagnostic access for laser based diagnostics such as interferometry, Thomson scattering and Faraday rotation imaging.

The initial version of PUFFIN will use two LTD5 modules, arranged into two lines of one module each (pictured below). We will use the results from this initial version of PUFFIN to secure funding for the upgraded version shown above.
