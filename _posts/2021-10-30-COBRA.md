Jack and Rishabh visited the COBRA pulsed-power facility at Cornell University in November 2021. Over two weeks, they characterized the plasma ablation and flows generated using planar wire arrays. The planar arrays were specifically designed to mimic the driving magnetic pressure and current per wire that the Z machine at Sandia National Labs would generate in cylindrical exploding wire arrays for the MARZ experimental campaign.
