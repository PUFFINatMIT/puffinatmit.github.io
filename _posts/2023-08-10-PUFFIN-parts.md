Lots is happening here at the PSFC on the PUFFIN project - our vacuum chamber has been welded together, the main support structure is complete and some of the really large items have arrived. The inner conductor of the transmission line has been polished smooth and we've done a preliminary fit test on many items. We're now at 85% completion for parts, so we anticipate assembling PUFFIN in early Fall.
