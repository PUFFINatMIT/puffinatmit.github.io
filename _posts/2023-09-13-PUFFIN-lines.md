Machining and welding of all the PUFFIN parts continues at a fast pace - today the first of the outer transmission lines had its flanges and diagnostic ports welded on. PUFFIN has two vacuum insulated coaxial transmission lines which take the current pulse from the two LTD5 modules to the central power junction and then up to the vacuum chamber. Both the inner and outer conductors started off as steel pipes, which have now had flanges welded to both ends. The outer transmission lines also features eight KF25 ports which we'll mount b-dot and d-dot probes inside to monitor the current and voltage on the transmission lines when PUFFIN fires.
