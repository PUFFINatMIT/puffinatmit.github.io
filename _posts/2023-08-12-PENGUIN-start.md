The Pulser for ENhancing Geothermal Utility and INnovation (PENGUIN) is a project recently started within the PUFFIN group. Its scope is to adapt an existing pulsed power supply for studying electrical reservoir stimulation. The pulser is mainly composed by a capacitor bank that can store up to 3 kJ at 100 kV and can be discharged quickly through saturated rock samples via spark-gap switches. Currently we are working on designing a "charge and dump" system which will allow us to operate safely the pulser.
