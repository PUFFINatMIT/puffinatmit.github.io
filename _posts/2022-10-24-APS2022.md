This year, Jack, Rishabh, and Thomas attended the 64th Annual Meeting of the APS Division of Plasma Physics (APS-DPP). The conference was held in Spokane, WA from 17-21 October. 

Jack presented simulation results from the MARZ magnetic-reconnection experiment, whilst Rishabh presented preliminary experimental results from the same campaign, characterizing the plasma flows in the first MARZ shot.

Thomas presented a poster on his recent experimental results from MAIZE, studying pulsed-power driven magnetic reconnection in an externally-generated guide field.
