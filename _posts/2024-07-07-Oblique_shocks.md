We're back from two weeks of experiments on the COBRA pulsed-power generator at Cornell University. Graduate student Rishabh Datta wrote a proposal which was funded through ZNetUS to study oblique shocks in pulsed-power-driven plasma flows. These shocks form at specific angles with respect to the surface of an angled obstacle, and the shock angle is a function of Mach number and the adiabatic index of the plasma. Along with undergraduate student Emily Neill and graduate students Simran Chowdhry and Lansing Horan IV, Rishabh gathered data with a range of obstacle configurations and diagnostics, including shadowgraphy, interferometry, and Thomson scattering.

We're grateful to the team at COBRA - Euan Freeman, Sander Lavine, Todd Blanchard, Dan Hawkes and Harry Wilhelm - for all of their assistance with these shots, as well as to the NNSA for supporting ZNetUS.
