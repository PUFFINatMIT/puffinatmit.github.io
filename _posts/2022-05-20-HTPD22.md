Rishabh attended the High-Temperature Diagnostics Conference, which was held in Rochester NY from May 15-19. The conference is dedicated to the development of instrumentation, experimental and analytical techniques, and machine learning for magnetic & inertial confinement fusion, high-energy-density plasmas, and laboratory astrophysics. Rishabh presented a new diagnostic technique which combines bow shock imaging with inductive probe measurements to measure the flow velocity and temperature in supersonic pulsed-power-driven plasmas.
