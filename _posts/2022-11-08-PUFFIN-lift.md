Today we had the structural engineer for the project visit so we could do a fit and stress test for the PUFFIN structural supports. 
This was the first time we had lifted one of the 550 kg LTD5 capacitor modules upright and loaded the supports.
The fit test went very well - there was no deflection and the module rolled easily on the supports.
Now we have to finish up the design for the power feed and vacuum chamber section ready for fabrication and assembly early next year.
