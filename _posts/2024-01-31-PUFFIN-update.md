We've made huge progress over the past month with the construction of PUFFIN. All of the most complex parts, such as the transmission lines and capacitor modules are now in place, thanks to the hard work of the skilled technicians and machinists as the Plasma Science and Fusion Center at MIT.

Our next steps to close all of the remaining holes in the system so we can pull vacuum and check for leaks. After that, we need to get our safety systems up and running so we can start doing charge tests before moving onto short circuits loads, and eventually making plasma!
