Each year, the Nuclear Science and Engineering (NSE) department at MIT hosts the NSE Research Expo; an internal, half-day event, where students from the department can present their work as a poster, or invited talk. This year's theme was "Foundations and Fontiers", and students were encouraged to demonstrate the societal impact of their research field. Thomas presented some initial results from his experiments on the MAIZE pulsed-power facility at the University of Michigan, and how these results along with PUFFIN can help develop our understanding of space weather and solar storms. For his poster, Thomas was awarded both the Judges' and Peoples' choice awards; congratulations!
