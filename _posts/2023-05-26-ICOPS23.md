Jack and Rishabh visited Santa Fe, NM for the International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS)---May 21-25---where they presented simulation and experimental results from the MARZ campaign, demonstrating
evidence for radiative collapse in pulsed-power-driven magnetic reconnection. Rishabh also gave a talk
after being shortlisted for the Student Paper Award, and was awarded an Honorable Mention.
