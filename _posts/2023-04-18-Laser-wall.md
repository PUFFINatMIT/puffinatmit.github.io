The PUFFIN facility sits inside the cavernous West Cell at the PSFC, a shared lab space with many users (most recently, the team building high temperature superconducting magnets!).
Our diagnostic laser is a safety hazard to other users in the West Cell, and to ensure we can all operate our experiments and facilities at the same time, we built this large wall surrounding PUFFIN.
