In April, Jack first travelled to Rochester for the NSF ECLIPSE (Ecosystem for Collaborative Leadership and Inclusive Innovation in Plasma Science and Engineering) meeting, which was carefully timed to take place during the solar eclipse! Unfortunately, the weather did not quite cooperate, but Jack presented on our three active NSF grants, on guide field reconnection, radiatively cooled reconnection, and magnetized turbulence.

The next week, Jack gave the joint Princeton/Institute for Advanced Study Astrophysics Colloquium in Peyton Hall, focusing on our radiatively-cooled reconnection experiments on Z. He also attended some of the 'Synergistic approaches to particle transport in magnetized turbulence: from the laboratory to astrophysics' workshop taking place at the Princeton Center for Theoretical Science just down the road at Jadwin Hall, as well as visiting the Institute for Advanced Study.
