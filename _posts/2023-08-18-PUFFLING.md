UROP student Osahon Odiase has recently finished developing PUFFLING–--a 30kV calibration pulser–--with the help of the PUFFIN team. We did our first fire of PUFFLING on August 2nd, 2023, where we conducted some capacitor tests and calibrated custom-made B-dots and Rogowski coils. The team will continue to use the calibration pulser to test and calibrate diagnostics for PUFFIN.
