Jack, Rishabh and Lansing travelled to Albuquerque NM to carry out the fourth Magnetic REconnection on Z (MARZ) shot. We fielded new diagnostics including laser imaging and streaked shadowgraphy, as well as redesigned visible spectroscopy and outflow inductive probes. The shot was very successful, and we look forward to sharing the results with you at a conference soon!
