Jack attended the Z Fundamental Science Workshop in Albuquerque NM, presenting results from our successful first shot on Z for the MARZ collaboration. The ZFSW brings together researchers from around the world to discuss the latest results and ideas for new research on Z, the most powerful pulsed-power machine in the world. You can find out more about MARZ on  [our Research page](/research/MARZ).
