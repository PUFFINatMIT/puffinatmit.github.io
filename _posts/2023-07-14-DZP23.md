Thomas, Rishabh, and Jack attended the Dense Z-Pinch (DZP) Conference in Ann Arbor, Michigan from July 9--13 this year. Jointly hosted by the University of Michigan and Sandia National Laboratories, this conference covers all aspects of theoretical and experimental z-pinch research. 

Thomas gave his first oral presentation at a conference, presenting on the experimental work conducted at the University of Michigan over the past few years. Using the MAIZE pulsed-power generator, he has been studying experimental methods of investigating guide field reconnection.

Rishabh also gave a talk, presenting on the experimental work he has been doing for the MARZ collaboration, studying radiatively cooled reconnection. Jack also presented on the MARZ collaboration work, but focused on the simulation work the group has been doing to support the campaign.
