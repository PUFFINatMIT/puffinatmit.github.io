Jack has received the NSF CAREER award,"National Science Foundation's most prestigious awards in support of early-career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education."
Jack will use the new PUFFIN facility to study magnetized turbulence by merging flux ropes using a pulsed-power driven cylindrical imploding carbon wire array, and will expand hands-on plasma physics training in the US by developing a new open-access plasma laboratory class with a virtual component.
