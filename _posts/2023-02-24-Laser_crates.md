We're very excited to welcome our diagnostic laser from EKSPLA. 
This is a Nd:YAG with a 2 ns pulse, outputting ~100 mJ at 1064 nm, 532 nm and 355 nm. 
The multiple wavelengths will allow us to split the beams and delay them, or perform multi-colour measurements.

We'll use this laser for shadowgraphy, schlieren imaging, interferometry, Faraday Rotation Imaging, and the new Imaging Refractometer that we published on a couple of years ago. 
Thanks to the NSF and the NNSA for supporting the acquisition of this laser through NSF PHY2108050.
