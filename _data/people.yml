  description: is an assistant professor in the Department of Nuclear 
               Science and Engineering. His doctoral research was on 
               magnetic reconnection driven by pulsed-power, carried 
               out at the MAGPIE facility at Imperial College London. 
               As well as magnetized high-energy-density plasmas, 
               Jack enjoys hiking, cycling, climbing and caving. His
