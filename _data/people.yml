  description: is an assistant professor in the Department of Nuclear 
               Science and Engineering. His doctoral research was on 
               magnetic reconnection driven by pulsed-power, carried 
               out at the MAGPIE facility at Imperial College London. 
               As well as magnetized high-energy-density plasmas, 
               Jack enjoys hiking, cycling, climbing and caving. His

  description:  is a postdoctoral research associate in the Plasma Science 
                and Fusion Center at MIT. During his PhD he built a pulsed 
                power supply demonstrator for the ASDEX Upgrade experiment 
                at the Max-Planck-Institute for Plasma Physics. Other than 
                power electronics for pulsed power applications, Antonio 
                enjoys playing soccer, swimming and riding one of his 
                Vespa scooters.
