  description: <p>Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental process in plasma physics, which breaks and 
               reforms magnetic field lines, converting magnetic energy into heat and kinetic energy. 
               The change in magnetic topology can also unleash dramatic events such as Coronal 
               Mass Ejections (CMEs) from the Sun, or lead to the devastating sawtooth instability 
               in a magnetic fusion reactor.</p>

               <p>Recently, the PUFFIN team carried out magnetic reconnection experiments 
               on the MAIZE pulsed-power generator at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor. These 
               experiments generated a vast amount of data, and this project is to help with the 
               data analysis. Working with a graduate student, you will learn about plasma physics 
               and plasma diagnostics, and contribute to a cutting edge research project which aims 
               to understand magnetic reconnection at a fundamental level.</p>

  description: <p>The new PUFFIN pulsed-power facility under construction at MIT
               will use intense electrical currents to produce dense plasmas and strong magnetic 
               fields, which interact to create supersonic, magnetized plasma flows. When these 
               flows collide with each other or solid obstacles, they produce extreme conditions 
               which can help us learn about astrophysical plasmas, such as the highly collimated 
               jets from Young Stellar Objects.</p>

               <p>One simple but versatile diagnostic for studying these plasmas is the "b-dot" or 
               inductive probe, a tiny loop of wire which is immersed in the plasma flow and 
               measures the temporal rate of change of the magnetic field. This project aims to 
               design, construct and test a small scale pulser (~1 kA peak current, ~100 ns rise time) 
               which can generate a sufficiently large and rapidly varying magnetic field for 
               calibrating b-dot probes for use on PUFFIN and other pulsed-power facilities around 
               the world.</p>
