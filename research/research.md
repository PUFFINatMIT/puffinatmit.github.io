# Our Research

PUFFIN is designed to be highly versatile, and will drive a range of loads in different geometries to produce
shocks and jets, magnetized turbulence, magnetic reconnection, and magnetized heat flow. Research areas of 
interest include magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, magnetic reconnection, and magnetized target fusion.
