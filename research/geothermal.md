# Geothermal Energy

The PUFFIN group at MIT is part of an ARPA-E OPEN funded project led by [Eden](https://www.edengeopower.com/), a geoscience technology development company founded by graduate students at MIT. Eden are developing a new method for [stimulating fractures in deep geothermal reservoirs](https://www.edengeopower.com/technology), to replace the hydraulic fracturing techniques developed by the oil and gas industry, which are ineffective at the depths and temperatures needed for geothermal power.

As experts in pulsed-power technology, our group is developing a lab-scale pulser to carry out experiments in conjunction with [Prof. Einstein's group in the CEE department](https://herbert-einstein.org/) at MIT, and we are also involved in the design work for a field-scale pulser which will be used at a variety of test sites worldwide to test the new electro-hydraulic fracturing approach pioneered by Eden.

You can read more about the project [in this press release from Eden](https://www.edengeopower.com/news/eden-annnouces-3-8m-apra-e-opem-2021-award-to-develop-next-generation-geothermal-stimulation-technology) and in [in this short news article at the PSFC](https://www.psfc.mit.edu/news/2022/psfc-to-explore-geothermal-stimulation-technology).
